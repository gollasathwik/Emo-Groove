# Emo-Groove

Emo-Groove. An innovative music recommendation system enabling real-time mood detection and dynamic playlist generation, greatly enhancing user experience through personalized music suggestions.

Our music player system is composed of three integrated modules: the Emotion Module, the Music Classification Module, and the Recommendation Module.

Emotion Module: This module captures an image of the user's face and utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms to accurately determine the user's current mood.

Music Classification Module: Using sophisticated audio feature analysis, this module classifies songs into various mood categories, ensuring an appropriate match for the user's emotional state.

Recommendation Module: By aligning the user's identified emotions with the classified mood types of songs, this module suggests personalized music recommendations. It also takes into account the user's individual preferences for an enhanced listening experience.
